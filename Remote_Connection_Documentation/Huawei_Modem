This document explains my limited experience setting up a Huawei Modem.

The modem is used to create a wifi hotspot using cellular data. When connected to a cellular network, it can support up to 10 devices connecting to it over wifi.  
 
To work, the device requires a standard sized GSM SIM (aka not what's used in any phone), and can only connect to 2G or 3G networks.  The SIM is inserted under the battery- to open up the device, pry it open at the corner that has a notch.  It may be hard to open but it does open to reveal the battery and SIM slot.

This video has good instructions for setting up the router: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCnadcK5beQ
Watch it if you want to set up a router! Here are a few notes from when I set the first one up, but the video is the best source.

############ Notes #################

When you need to put in APN info, note that the user name / password don't refer to YOUR username or password anywhere. They simply identify the network, and you can find them on google.  For example, for the ATNT SIM I've tried it on, the APN was:

APN: wap.cingular
Username:WAP@CINGULARGPRS
Password: CINGULAR1

To connect to the router, remember that the SSID and password are written on the back of the cover of the router. 

Finally, if the router is getting cell signal, the wireless bars on the front will be green.  If it is broadcasting Wifi, the wifi icon will be lit green.
